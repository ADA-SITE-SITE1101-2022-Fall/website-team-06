                Let us introduce ourselves. Our team consists of

                    attended our team's presentation on ADA University and the

                    to university life, we moved on to solving Code.org puzzles. Using a brief yet engaging game,
                    we attempted to explain the fundamentals of programming to kids following the presentation.

                    we played "Zombie VS. Plants" before moving on to the "Ice Age" puzzles.</b></p><img id="img2" src="media/event (13).jpg">

                    like to thank the staff of School No. 276 and the fourth graders for their assistance in making this event a success.</b></p>

                    teach our understanding of the codes to others.</b></p><img id="img3" src="media/event (1).jpg">
